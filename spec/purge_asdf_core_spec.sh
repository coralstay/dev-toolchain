# Regression tests for scripts/uninstall/05_purge_asdf_core.sh:
# - TASK-70: must respect a live ASDF_DATA_DIR override, same as
#   ensure_asdf_on_path() does, instead of always deleting the default
#   $HOME/.asdf regardless of where asdf's data actually lives.
# - m-13/TASK-124/decision-6: must NOT blindly rm -rf the asdf data dir if
#   the install-time snapshot (TASK-123) says it existed before
#   langtoolchain ever ran, or if that snapshot is missing entirely (safe
#   default: skip + warn, never "assume safe to delete").
# - TASK-144: `brew uninstall asdf` itself must be gated by the
#   asdf_preexisting snapshot key the exact same way — confirmed by real UAT
#   that an earlier version deleted a pre-existing Homebrew-installed asdf
#   for real, even though the data dir/plugins were correctly kept.

  SCRIPT='./scripts/uninstall/05_purge_asdf_core.sh'

  # `brew` is always Mocked below, never left to resolve for real - this dev
  # machine has a real asdf installed via real Homebrew, and DRY_RUN=false
  # below would otherwise make `run brew uninstall asdf` execute for real.
  # A PATH restriction alone is NOT enough to prevent that: the script now
  # calls ensure_brew_on_path() (TASK-78), which re-adds Homebrew's fixed
  # install prefix (e.g. /opt/homebrew/bin) unconditionally, regardless of
  # what PATH already contains - an earlier version of this file relied on
  # PATH restriction only, and a real `brew uninstall asdf` slipped through
  # against this actual dev machine once TASK-78 started calling
  # ensure_brew_on_path() here. Mock is what actually shadows `brew`
  # regardless of PATH tricks, since it wins by being resolved first.
