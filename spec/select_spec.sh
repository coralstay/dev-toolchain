# shellcheck shell=bash
# Tests for scripts/install/00_select.sh's non-interactive paths (--all,
# --local[=DIR]). The interactive /dev/tty prompt path isn't covered here -
# it genuinely needs a real terminal (see backlog TASK-27/39/47) - but
# every non-interactive branch (the one `curl | bash` actually takes in a
# script/CI context, since there's no controlling tty) is deterministic and
# exercised here.
