# Regression guard for TASK-105: install.sh and uninstall.sh are deliberately
# separate, independently curl-able entry points (see readme.md's "코드
# 구조" section) - never bundled into one script that dispatches on a mode
# flag. This locks that decision in so a future edit can't quietly merge
# them back together.

' uninstall.sh - not bundled'
    # Comments cross-referencing the sibling file for maintainers are fine
    # and expected (see both files' own header comments) - what this guards
    # against is an actual `sh uninstall.sh` / dispatch-on-mode-flag call.
