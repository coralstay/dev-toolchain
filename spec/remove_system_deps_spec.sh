# Regression tests for scripts/uninstall/04_remove_system_deps.sh (also the
# file at the center of TASK-78: missing ensure_brew_on_path caused brew
# cleanup to silently no-op when brew wasn't already on this process's
# PATH). `brew` is always Mocked here - never left to resolve for real, per
# the TASK-81 lesson (PATH restriction alone isn't a safe enough guard,
# since ensure_brew_on_path re-adds Homebrew's fixed prefix regardless).
