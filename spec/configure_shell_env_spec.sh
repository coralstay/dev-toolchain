# shellcheck shell=bash
# Regression tests for scripts/install/04_configure_shell_env.sh:
# - PATH ordering: the "eval $(brew shellenv)" line must stay ahead of the
#   asdf shim PATH line in the rc file, or a same-named Homebrew formula
#   silently shadows the asdf-managed version. This exact bug was found and
#   fixed on real hardware once already (commit f19057d) - this test exists
#   so it can't silently come back.
# - Idempotency: re-running the installer against an rc file that already
#   has these lines must not duplicate them.
