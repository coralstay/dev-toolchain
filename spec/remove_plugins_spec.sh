# Regression tests for scripts/uninstall/02_remove_plugins.sh - removes
# EVERY installed asdf plugin this tool is responsible for (not just this
# repo's own 5 languages), the TASK-77 trailing-newline fix for `asdf
# plugin list`'s output, and (TASK-130) skips any plugin the install-time
# snapshot says pre-existed langtoolchain, same safety guarantee
# 05_purge_asdf_core.sh already has for the asdf data dir.
# `asdf` is always Mocked, not left to resolve for real.
