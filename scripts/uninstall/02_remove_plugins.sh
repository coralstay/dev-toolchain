# up front: same lt_prior_state_get() helper 05_purge_asdf_core.sh already
# uses, not a new lib.sh function — this list is only ever consulted here,
# at this one call site, so an inline case-pattern word match below is
# simpler than adding a helper for a single caller (TASK-130.1).
#
# A failed lookup (snapshot file missing entirely, or missing this key) is
# the same "installed before this feature existed, or via --dry-run" case
# phase 5 treats as unknown → safe default: every plugin is treated as if
# it pre-existed, so uninstall touches none of them rather than guess.
