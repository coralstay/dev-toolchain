  # macOS's BSD sed requires an explicit (even if empty) backup suffix
  # argument to -i; '.bak' also means we never destructively edit the rc
  # file without a recovery copy sitting right next to it.
  #
  # -E (extended regex): earlier versions of this script alternated
  # `\(zsh\|bash\)` for the java hook line, which is silently NOT
  # alternation on BSD sed (macOS's stock /usr/bin/sed) without -E — `\|`
  # is a GNU extension to POSIX basic regex. lt_env_var_defs()'s single
  # "set-java-home\." pattern below sidesteps that entirely (it matches
  # either variant without needing alternation), but -E is kept since nothing
  # here depends on BRE-specific behavior either.
  #
  # Each search pattern comes from lib.sh's lt_env_var_defs() (TASK-64) —
  # the same list install/04_configure_shell_env.sh writes from — instead
  # of an independently-typed copy here. `\#pattern#d` (not `/pattern/d`):
  # some patterns (e.g. "opt/sqlite/bin") contain literal `/`, and a custom
  # sed delimiter avoids having to escape those.
  #
  # POSIX sh has neither arrays nor process substitution. lt_env_var_defs()
  # goes to a temp file first; the -e/expression pairs accumulate one per
  # line in SED_ARGS (not space-joined) so a pattern containing a literal
  # space (e.g. "brew shellenv") still becomes exactly one sed argument —
  # `set --` below re-splits only on the newlines, never on the spaces
  # inside a line.
